In order for this to work, you must have python 3.12 or higher (older version may work, but no guarantee).
This is built heavily on yt_dlp

--WINDOWS USERS--

Install python for command line.
Run the command python3 -m pip install yt_dlp.
If yt_dlp is installed, run the command python3 -m pip install --upgrade yt_dlp.
cd into the directory with the files.
run the command python3 UI.py.
Optionally create .bat file to automate last two steps.

--LINUX USERS--

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install yt-dlp
